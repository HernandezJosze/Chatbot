Welcome!


To run this project, it is only necessary to have installed python, docker and docker-compose!
There is a Makefile in the Backend that could help you to run it all.

Make sure of reviewing the env files in Chatbot/Backend/docker-compose and Chatbot/Backend/webserver, these are only examples, you should modify them to set your own password and user for your database

Additionally, there is a deployed frontend that could help you to test this project easily. It is pointing to localhost, so once you have your services in local running, you should be able to test it out!.

So Remember! 

Make sure of having python, docker, docker compose to run it locally after that, you only need to be located in Chatbot/Backend/docker-compose to make use of the makefile and play with the services!
