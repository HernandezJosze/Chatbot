# Chatbot

Welcome!


To run this project, it is only necessary to have installed python, docker and docker-compose!
There is a Makefile in the Backend that could help you to run it all.

Make sure of reviewing the env files in Chatbot/Backend/docker-compose and Chatbot/Backend/webserver/.env, these are only examples and you should modify them to set your own password and user for your database

additionally there is a deploy frontend that could help you to test this project easily. It will be active for a couple of days only.
The responses times could vary, since it running on a not that powerful computer, but I believe it is fast enough! 

So Remember! 

Make sure of having python, docker, docker compose!

After that, you only need to be located in Chatbot/Backend/docker-compose to make use of the makefile and play with the services!
